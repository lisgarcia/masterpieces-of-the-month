We provide users with the ability to experience art in a unique way. The masterpieces of the months will show a mosaic of artworks from artists with a specific birth month and allow the user to select a piece to see more details about the work, a fun way to learn.

As a user, I want to select a month from a dropdown menu. On submit, I want to see a mosaic of artworks from artists born in a given month, to celebrate and learn more about their work. I want images to glow on hover, and expand on click, displaying further details about a given image. I want to have the ability to like a piece of art to show my support. I want to have the ability to upload or delete a piece of art, to customize my experience.

User will be able to:
View different pieces (GET)
Create a “favorite art list/your own collection” -  this would be done on local and then pieces would be selected from the public external API (POST)
Remove a piece from their screen (DELETE)
Change the rating of pieces in our own collection (PATCH)
Users can search based on criteria and it’ll display a set of thumbnails. If they click on one, they can get more info.
